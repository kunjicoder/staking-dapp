# STK Staking dApp

A Web3 staking dApp on Sepolia: an ERC-20 token with a faucet (`claim()` mints 100 STK with an on-chain cooldown) and a staking contract that pays rewards over time.

- **contracts/** — Hardhat project: `StakeToken.sol` (ERC-20, faucet mints 100 STK / 6h cooldown, one-time minter grant) and `Staking.sol` (per-second reward accrual, ~3154% APR demo rate, rewards minted on claim). See [contracts/README.md](contracts/README.md) for deploy/verify instructions.
- **backend/** — Express API + on-chain event indexer. Polls Sepolia every 15s for `Staked` / `Unstaked` / `Claimed` and faucet mints (`Transfer` from `0x0`), stores them idempotently in Supabase. Auth is Sign-In-With-Ethereum → 24h JWT; wallets listed in `ADMIN_ADDRESSES` get `role: admin`.
- **frontend/** — user app: dashboard, faucet claim with countdown, approve→stake flow, unstake, claim rewards, history.
- **admin/** — admin-only dashboard: overview with charts (recharts), per-wallet staker table with live on-chain balances, filterable activity feed.
- **shared/abi/** — contract artifacts (ABI) imported by all three web apps, copied from `contracts/artifacts/` (see [shared/abi/README.md](shared/abi/README.md)).

All API amounts are raw 18-decimal uint256 values serialized as strings; frontends format with `formatUnits`.

## API summary

| Route | Auth | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | — | Liveness check |
| `GET /auth/nonce` | — | SIWE nonce (5-min expiry, single use) |
| `POST /auth/login` | — | `{ message, signature }` → `{ token, wallet, role }` |
| `GET /api/stats` | — | TVL (live on-chain) + event counts |
| `GET /api/activity?limit=` | — | Recent events, newest first |
| `GET /api/me/position` | JWT | Live balance / staked / rewards for the JWT wallet |
| `GET /api/me/activity` | JWT | The JWT wallet's events |
| `GET /api/admin/stakers` | admin | Every seen wallet with live on-chain position (30s cache) |
| `GET /api/admin/activity?type=&wallet=&from=&to=&limit=&offset=` | admin | Filterable, paginated feed |
| `GET /api/admin/stats` | admin | Totals + 14-day per-day counts and cumulative-staked series |
| `GET /api/admin/wallet/:address` | admin | Position + activity for one wallet |

## Security considerations

**Secrets & configuration**
- `.env` files are gitignored — only `.env.example` templates are committed. No secrets live in the repo.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` is used **server-side only** (it bypasses row-level security) and is never sent to a browser or bundled into the frontends.
- `JWT_SECRET` must be a long random value, set only on the backend host.
- Frontends only ever receive `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values (API URL, public contract addresses, optional RPC) — never service keys or signing secrets.

**Authentication & authorization**
- Login is Sign-In-With-Ethereum: nonces are single-use with a 5-minute TTL, and the backend verifies the signature, the `chainId` (Sepolia), and the message `domain` against the allow-listed origins.
- Sessions are 24h JWTs signed with `JWT_SECRET`; every protected route re-verifies the token server-side.
- Admin access is decided **on the server** from `ADMIN_ADDRESSES` (encoded into the JWT as `role`), never trusted from the client.
- CORS is restricted to the origins in `FRONTEND_ORIGINS`; the same list drives the SIWE domain check.

**On-chain**
- The faucet cooldown and all reward accounting are enforced **on-chain**; the backend/UI only read state and cannot grant tokens.
- Wallet transactions are signed client-side in the user's wallet — the apps never handle private keys.

**Known limitations (by design, testnet demo)**
- JWTs are stored in `localStorage`, which is readable by JavaScript (XSS exposure) — acceptable for a testnet demo, but a production app should prefer httpOnly cookies.
- The contracts are **unaudited** and the reward rate (~3154% APR) is a deliberately high demo value, not realistic economics.
- STK is a **Sepolia testnet** token with no real value; the faucet mints freely within its cooldown.
